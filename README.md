List of features: (with code requirements 1-5)

1. Generation of random game sets or events:
    random poker cards generated by rand() seeded by srand(time(NULL))
2. Data structures for storing game status:
  user defined type (struct) for User and Card
3. Dynamic memory management:
  vectors to store users and cards
  pointer to player's inventory

4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status):
  load game / save game
5. Program codes in multiple files:
  Makefile, header files, function files, the main file

Account system:
  (2,3,4): used struct to make a User type, store all the users in a vector, user information can be loaded/saved through file i/o
  unique id name
  supports multiple single players
  leaderboard: rank by descending scores, lexicographically

   type 5 to save game status to a file in the same directory as the program files
   type 6 to halt the program
   (academy11 was used for testing) the code can be successfully compiled in the Computer Science department's academy11 server.
